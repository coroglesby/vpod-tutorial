# <i style='color:black;' class='fab fa-twitter'></i> Managing the VPOD Twitter

The WordPress site is configured to automatically tweet when a scheduled poem is published. This tweet is formatted as such:

<pre style="background-color:grey">
Today's poem: #title# by #tags#,  courtesy of @canariumbooks

Read the poem!  #url#
</pre>

Remember to check this every day at some point in case the automation messed up (which it sometimes does).
